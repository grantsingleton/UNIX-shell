## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/grantsingleton/UNIX-shell/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/grantsingleton/UNIX-shell/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Description
This is a basic UNIX shell implementation that is running on a Linux sub-system in Windows, written in C++. Here is how it works...

### Enter the Shell
Once I run the command. I get the current path of the directory I am in.

I can run ls and view the contents of this folder.

I can make a new directory...

### Change Directory
I can change directories. Here I change into the empty directory that I made.

### Make a File
Make a new file with 'touch' and view it in the directory.

### Input Redirection
Write to the file using 'echo' and input redirection, then read it using 'cat'.

### Piping
I made a small text file called "animals.txt" that I will use to demonstrate piping.
